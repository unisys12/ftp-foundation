## Guardian Home
<sub>What does it mean to be a Guardian Home?</sub>
Being a Guardian Home is the same as fostering. We use the phrase <i>Guardian Home</i> to help convey the
message that you will be guarding a precious soul in your home. These dogs have been through so much and
experience so much change that emotionally, they can be very fragile.
<blockquote>
    You will be giving a rescued dog or cat a positive environment so they can have the emotional stability
    they need to thrive.
