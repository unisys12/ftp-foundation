Our board is made up of members with a vast array of different professional backgrounds. From Teaching to social work, nursing to technical. One thing that we all have in common is a passion for animals. Once Kim got the general idea for the foundation nailed down, she began talking about it with different people and clients. Later, she asked herself, "Who have I talked with about this and was the most excited and asked the most questions?" From that list, we chose our board members.
