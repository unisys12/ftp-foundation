        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>We have a <i>grand</i> vision for For The Puppies Foundation. We will be the first to admit that. Given that,
            we recognize that will not be able to accomplish everything, all at once, in the beginning. But given enough
            time and resources, we feel confident that each of the following are obtainable.</p>

        <h3>Guardian Homes</h3>
        <p>Hands down the most important aspect of what we want to accomplish. Recruiting Guardians to be fosters will
            be vital in our early stages. Granted, it will be important through all phases, but since we are just
            starting - refining this process into a workflow that is easy for everyone to understand is very important.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Status Update</b>
            <p>We are putting together the Guardian Application, which will be the first step in becoming a
                Guardian. Also, discussions have started on the subject of contracts/agreements that should be signed
                between parties.</p>

        <h3>Passion for Paws - Spay and Neuter Program</h3>
        <p>Our county <i>(Alcorn County, Ms)</i> recently had their only Low Cost Program put on hold. We are hoping
            that it returns, but they
            were not able to perform as many procedures needed to have a real impact on the community. Having two
            programs, one of which could be Free for qualified families, would be a game changer.</p>
        <p>One of the other benefits that we want to offer is free transportation for those that cannot afford to make a
            trip out of town to have their dog altered.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Status Update</b>
            <p>We have started the conversation on the subject of our Low Cost/Free spay and neuter program. We have
                spoken with an individual that has experience in Spay & Neuter programs and is willing to help us get
                this project off the ground. We are also in the process of contacting local <i>(within a 30 mile
                    radius)</i> vets that would willing to coordinate with us on performing the operations.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>All dogs want to do is make us happy. It's true! Study after study has proven this fact. And all we need to
            do is take the time necessary to learn how to properly communicate with them. Once we can communicate with
            them, it is up to us to let them know what we want. On the flip side of that, it is up to us to figure our
            what they need and provide that for them. Just like any other human relationship that you have ever been a
            part of, it's a two way street. It takes two to communicate.</p>
        <p>We want to provide free group training classes for each of our Guardian Homes. Not only preparing Guardian
            Homes for future dogs or cats, but giving each and every dog a new lease on life. We will be able to award
            the AKC CGC Ready Certificate to dog, which the rescue will be able to display in all marketing for the
            animals adoption. Showing the perspective adopter that they are adopting a dog that is ready to handle a new
            life, in a new home.</p>

        <h3>Community Center</h3>
        <p>This is going to be a long-term goal that we have set for our foundation.</p>
        <p>We want to build out a community center where we can have our own low-cost/free vet clinic, training
            facility, dog park, grooming center... you name. The sky is the limit! And make it all available to our
            surrounding communities. Services will require a paid donation, to help fund the center. No real hard
            details have been set for this project and will be tackled once proper funding is available and other
            projects are running smoothly.</p>
